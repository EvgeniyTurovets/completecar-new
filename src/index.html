          <p>
            For most people, a vehicle is the second most expensive thing they will purchase in their life next to a home. Unfortunately, vehicles break down, which is why experts recommend all drivers carry an auto warranty. The dealership where you purchase your vehicle will usually offer a warranty for the first 3 to 4 years, but once that expires you become completely vulnerable. We all know how expensive unexpected auto repairs can be, especially since mechanics can charge in excess of  $200 per hour for labor alone. Don’t become another statistic. Let Complete Car Warranty help you save money today!

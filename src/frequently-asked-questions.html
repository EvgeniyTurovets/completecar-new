                          If I still have a manufacturer warranty, then why should I buy a vehicle service contract now?

                              The cost and coverage available in a vehicle service contract is heavily dependent upon the mileage on the vehicle and the condition it’s in. The longer you own a vehicle, the more miles you’re going to put on it, adding to the wear and tear. The better the condition of your vehicle and the lower the mileage, the less you’ll pay.

                            A vehicle service contract is an optional service you can buy to help pay for the cost of certain vehicle repairs. It normally picks up once the manufacturer’s warranty ends, but sometimes the two can overlap.

                          What is the difference between vehicle service contracts and extended vehicle warranties?

                        <ul class="text">

                              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extended Vehicle Warranties provide comparable coverage to the original warranty, but not exact, and usually have exclusions based on mileage. Warranties are only sold with the purchase of a new vehicle and are pegged to the retail price of the vehicle itself. Legally, only the original manufacturer can “extend” a warranty, so anything else is technically a vehicle service contract.</span></p>
                              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vehicle Service Contracts are sometimes known as aftermarket warranties, auto service contracts for cars, or extended car warranties, although they are not actual warranties. A vehicle service contract provides coverage for costly repairs after the manufacturer’s warranty expires and is a direct agreement between you and the provider. Different plans are available with varying degrees of coverage and for different prices that are not tied to the retail price of your vehicle.</span></p>
